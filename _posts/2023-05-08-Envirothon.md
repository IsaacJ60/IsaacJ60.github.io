# Envirothon: An Overview of the Environmentally Themed Competition for High Schoolers

Attending competitions as a high schooler is an important aspect of academic success. In this post, we will be focusing on NCF-Envirothon, which can help develop students’ environmental and natural resource management skills. Specifically, Envirothon strengthens students in area such as:

- Aquatic Ecology
- Forestry
- Soils and Land Use
- Wildlife
- Current Environmental Issues

## What is Envirothon?
Envirothon is a program that wishes to educate students about the environment and natural resources through running workshops and competitions. By giving students the experience they need to enter into an environmentally focused career path, they hope to inspire change throughout the world.

Competitions and resources offered:
- The NCF-Envirothon
- Diversity Grant
- iNaturalist Project

Through Envirothon, students gain practical knowledge and skills related to natural resource management and conservation, while also developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. The competition is designed to promote environmental awareness and stewardship among young people, and to inspire the next generation of environmental leaders. Envirothon is offered in many states and countries around the world, and has engaged thousands of students in environmental education and conservation efforts.

## Benefits of the Envirothon competition
While there are some obvious benefits of attending competitions, such as resume boosting or gaining experience in a field, there may be some that get overlooked. Let’s take a look at those!

### Reducing your Carbon Footprint
Getting educated about practical steps you can take to lower your energy consumption and reduce waste is something everyone should be doing. By implementing these steps, you can lower your carbon emissions and make a positive impact on the environment. Additionally, participating in the competition can provide motivation and a sense of community, making it easier to sustain these environmentally friendly habits over time.
### Teamwork, Critical Thinking, and Problem Solving
Participating in the Envirothon competition can improve students' teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. As a team-based competition, Envirothon requires students to work collaboratively to solve complex problems related to the environment. Through this process, students learn to communicate effectively, listen to each other's ideas, and value each other's contributions. Additionally, Envirothon challenges students to think critically and creatively, analyse data, and evaluate different perspectives. The competition provides an opportunity for students to apply their problem-solving skills in a real-world context, identify and prioritise environmental problems, develop and evaluate solutions, and communicate their findings effectively. These skills are essential for addressing complex environmental issues and can benefit students in their academic and professional careers.
### Valuable Technical Skills
Participating in the Envirothon competition can help students develop various technical skills related to natural resource management and environmental science. For example, students can learn about identifying plants and wildlife, conducting soil analyses, interpreting maps and aerial photos, and understanding water quality. These technical skills are essential for effective environmental management and conservation. Also, Envirothon offers students an opportunity to gain hands-on experience and knowledge in these areas, which can be valuable for future careers in fields such as environmental science, conservation, and natural resource management.

## Examples of Envirothon projects
Here are some excellent projects that can give you inspiration for your own Envirothon project!
Stream Restoration Project
This project involves restoring and improving the health of a local stream or river. Students may work to remove invasive species, plant native vegetation, stabilise eroding banks, and monitor water quality.
### Sustainable Agriculture Project
You’d be promoting sustainable farming practices and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture. Students may work to promote soil health, reduce pesticide and fertiliser use, and improve water management.
Wildlife Habitat Enhancement Project
Habitat projects involve creating or improving habitat for local wildlife species. Students may work to plant native vegetation, create nesting or roosting sites, and monitor wildlife populations.
### Renewable Energy Project
This focuses on promoting the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power. Students may work to design and install solar panels or wind turbines, and monitor energy production and usage.
Environmental Education Project
An education project involves promoting environmental education and awareness in the local community. Students may organise events or activities to educate others about environmental issues, promote sustainable practices, and encourage environmental stewardship.

## How to get started with Envirothon?

If you are interested in getting started with Envirothon, here are a few steps you can take!
### Find a local Envirothon program
The first step is to find a local Envirothon program in their area. Students can check with their school, local conservation district, or state department of environmental protection to find a program near them.
### Form or join a team
Envirothon is a team-based competition, so students will need to form or join a team of five students. They can form a team with friends, classmates, or other interested individuals.
### Get a coach
Each Envirothon team needs a coach to guide and support them throughout the competition. The coach can be a teacher, parent, or other adult who is knowledgeable about the environment and can provide guidance and support.
### Start studying and practising
Once the team is formed, they can start studying and practising for the competition. The competition covers topics such as soil and land use, aquatic ecology, forestry, and wildlife, so students should start researching and learning about these topics.
### Attend workshops and training sessions
Many Envirothon programs offer workshops and training sessions to help students prepare for the competition. Students should take advantage of these opportunities to learn from experts and gain hands-on experience.
